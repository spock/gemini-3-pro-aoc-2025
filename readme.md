Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels.

You do not need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.
If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something?
Is your program doing something you don't expect?
After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.

Each subfolder is one day of the AoC, and contains the following files:
- task.md, which describes the coding puzzle
- input.txt, that has the input.

For each day, build a Python script to solve the puzzle, and save the result into "output1.txt".

Two puzzles will be made available on each day; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first, and will be appended to the task.md file.
If the second puzzle is available, then create a new script to solve the second puzzle. It is often a variation of a solution for the first puzzle of the day.
Save the answer into "output2.txt".
