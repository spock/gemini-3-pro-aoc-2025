I'm NOT participating in AoC, not really.  
And thus also not competing.  
I haven't written or read any lines of code yet. 

I'm testing which day will gemini 3 pro thinking have issues with.  
The first 4 days were completed correctly on the first try within 1-2 minutes.  
I'd expect days 5 and 6 to be more difficult and cause a failure.

I've provided a basic coding puzzle description and instructions at the root of the repository.  
There is a folder for each day, that has task.md and input.txt.  
My "prompt" is usually just "solve day X"; when it is done, just "now solve part two of day X", and that's it. 

For day 4, given that it's a symbolic 2D map, I'm impressed there were no hiccups solving it.  
And the solution script seems to only have 20 lines or so.

Day five part two was the first where "thinking" phase started getting slower - 25 seconds for one such phase.  
The problem was still solved within 2 or at most 3 minutes.  

Day six part two had a 42-second thinking phase. The puzzle was still correctly solved within 2-3 minutes.
