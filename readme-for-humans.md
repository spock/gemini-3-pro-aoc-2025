I'm NOT participating in AoC, not really.  
And thus also not competing.  
I haven't written or read any lines of code yet. 

I'm testing which day will gemini 3 pro thinking have issues with.  
The first 4 days were completed correctly on the first try within 1-2 minutes.  
I'd expect days 5 and 6 to be more difficult and cause a failure.

For day 4, given that it's a symbolic 2D map, I'm impressed there were no hiccups solving it.  
And the solution script seems to only have 20 lines or so.

I've provided a basic coding puzzle description and instructions at the root of the repository.  
There is a folder for each day, that has task.md and input.txt.  
My "prompt" is usually just "solve day X"; when it is done, just "now solve part two of day X", and that's it.
