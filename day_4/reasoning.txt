Planning Day 4 Solution
Analyzed Day 4 requirements. Need to count rolls of paper (@) accessible by forklifts (fewer than 4 adjacent @).

Implementation plan
- Script to read day_4/input.txt
- Parse the grid.
- Identify all rolls of paper (@).
- For each roll of paper:
    - Count the number of adjacent (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) positions that also contain a roll of paper (@).
    - If the count is < 4, it is accessible.
    - Count the total number of accessible rolls of paper.
- Output result to console and day_4/output1.txt

Executing Implementation

I'm making progress on Day 4 Task 1.  
The implementation plan is approved.  
Now, I'm working on day_4/solve_task1.py.  
The plan involves reading and parsing the input grid from day_4/input.txt.  
I'll locate all the '@' characters and count their adjacent cells.

Defining Accessibility Logic

My focus is now on the core logic: Determining accessibility based on neighbor counts.  
The plan is to filter @ characters and their surroundings, applying the < 4 neighbor rule.  
Then, I'll count the accessible '@' characters for the output.  
I'm aiming for a straightforward implementation.

Testing the Script

I've got the script written and am now running it.  
I'm eager to see the results and will refine the execution based on the output.  
I'm anticipating some interesting results.

Updating Execution Result

I've just successfully executed the script, yielding a result of 1393.  
My next step is to update the user walkthrough accordingly and send out a notification to keep everyone informed.  
It's a key milestone.

I have solved Day 4 Task 1.  
The number of accessible rolls is 1393.  
I've updated the walkthrough.
